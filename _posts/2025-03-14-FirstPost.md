Walking Through a Tutorial Blind: A Learning Adventure

Have you ever jumped into a tutorial with absolutely no background knowledge‚Äîjust clicking through, hoping for the best? That was me today.

I found a tutorial on GitHub Pages Site Creation.  There was not an overview.  I couldn't check prerequisites, or even skim ahead. So, I just dove in. No prep, no expectations, just raw curiosity.

The Experience

At first, everything seemed straightforward. Step 1: Do this. Step 2: Run that. Easy enough. But by Step 4, I realized I had no idea why I was doing any of it. Concepts flew past me, and I started hitting roadblocks. Missing dependencies? Check. Unfamiliar commands? Double check.

But instead of quitting, I embraced the chaos. A quick ChatGPT search here, a side quest into documentation there, and eventually, things started to click.

What I Learned
	1.	Blindly following a tutorial teaches process, not understanding. I could make things work, but I didn‚Äôt really know why‚Äîuntil I stopped and asked questions.
	2.	Mistakes are part of the process. Every error message was an invitation to learn something new.
	3.	Sometimes struggling is the best way to learn. Tutorials make things look easy, but real learning happens in the moments of ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. Walking through a tutorial blind forced me to explore, problem-solve, and ultimately, retain more than I would have if I‚Äôd just followed the steps like a robot. Next time, though, I might at least read the introduction first.

Have you ever taken on a tutorial this way? How did it go?
